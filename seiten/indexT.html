            <p>Success is on its way, but you’ll need to protect your energy, time, and finances as you move forward. A bit of conflict, competition, or tension may arise, yet there’s no real threat—these challenges are temporary and superficial. Your path is already supported, and the outcome is set to work in your favor.
            Additionally, a boost in confidence and motivation is coming, helping you push through obstacles with ease. You may also attract helpful allies or resources at just the right moment, reinforcing that you're moving toward something truly rewarding.</p>

It suggests you’re closing an important chapter, navigating something unclear, and then moving toward healing and a positive, inspired outcome.You may need to trust your intuition as you move through this transition.

Your true tool is your mind; through intelligence and clear analysis, you can open the path to your own progress, especially in material matters.

            <p>You may enter a partnership, or a new love might come into your life. It’s a positive and fortunate development, but you must be careful not to lose your personal power within it. Your inner strength and ability to manage things can weaken when you share responsibility, and at times you may struggle to organize your own resources effectively.

            The best way to grow through this is to practice balance in every area of your life—especially in love, partnership, and moments when you’re handling two things at once. Maintaining balance may feel more challenging, but it will become your greatest strength.</p>

Mentally, you feel scattered and overwhelmed. It’s hard for you to set clear boundaries between good and bad, or even between reality and imagination.

          Even if you haven’t realized it yet, I’m here to tell you that you’re simply exhausted and need time to recover. All these thoughts, worries, and multiple mental options are pulling you away from the real and important choice. You’ve missed an opportunity once before—so be mindful this time.</p>

            <p>You have a strong inner intuition that constantly sends you clear, authentic messages to guide your decisions. These insights come to you quickly, and whenever you need them, they are available. What you are reading now is also a message from your inner guidance.

            You’ve taken on far more responsibility than your energy can handle, and it’s time to release some of the tasks that aren’t truly necessary. This load has become heavy, and your strength is reaching its limit. Avoid making rushed decisions that could push you into even more pressure and responsibility.

            <p>The question on your mind is about stability. My suggestion is to improve the atmosphere and relationships within your home or workspace. Give more attention to creating security, comfort, and happiness under your own roof. Part of your responsibility is to build harmony and balance in this space.

By doing so, you’ll notice a strong forward movement in other areas of your life as well. You may be surprised to discover how much progress and opportunity appear simply from nurturing this one foundation.</p>

            <h3>About Tarot</h3>
             <p>Tarot cards were invented in 15th-century Europe, particularly in <b>Italy</b>, as an aristocratic card game.
              <br>Until the <b>18th century</b>, they had no connection to divination.
              <p>Around 1780 <b>(about 250 years ago)</b>, a French mystic named <b>Etteilla</b> was the first to use them for fortune-telling.</p>
              <p>Since then, tarot has gradually evolved from a simple game into a mystical and spiritual tool.</p>
